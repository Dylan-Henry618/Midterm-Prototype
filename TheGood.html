      <h2>What's this? Something Good?</h2>
      <p>Indeed, it seems too good to be true and maybe it is, but I'm not going to critisize an <b>actual</b> good game. However, it was disapointing to see that the sequel was so dispointing, but we can only hope for future games to be as innovative as this one.</p>

      <p>Seriously this wasn't considered best game of 2019 for nothing, and maybe it's not the most original idea, but it's really hard to come up with new ideas. This should be inspiration for others to keep trying to make games that have an original idea even if the gameplay is very similar to other games. In this case Dark souls was the obvious influence but how it was evolved was very well done.</p>
      <p>Games more recenetly such as Ghost of Tsushima look to incorporate similar concepts but apply them in a different genre which seemed to go over well!</p>

      <p><b>Can you believe that this game came back? We had a long period where DOOM was just another classic game that had sequels no one wanted, but now it is a mainstay and doesn't seem to be stopping in how awesome it can be.</b></p>

        <p>Another series that probably no one was talking for a while, but after taking the best soundtrack of 2019, it just really makes you think what is it with Capcom's relationship with cult classics and bringing them back from non-existence to just awesome titles.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Seriously though, these are games that we should inspiration to. Adding onto a game and just showing that as a developer you really are inspired to make this game because you actually like it and not for financial reasons.</p>
